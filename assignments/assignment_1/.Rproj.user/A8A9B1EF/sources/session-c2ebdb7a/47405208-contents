## Key Concepts Learned
- Vector Data Model
  * Simplified geometric representations
  * Three basic types: points, lines, polygons
  * Each feature has geometry and attributes
- sf Package
   * Modern replacement for older spatial packages
   * Integrates with tidyverse workflows
   * Spatial data is just data.frame + geometry column
   * g <- ggplot(data = your_data) + aes(x = income, y = %_bach) + geom_something (color = "blue")
- Exploratory data analysis - what does the data look like? what patterns exist?

## Coding Techniques
- aes (aesthethic) describes how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties of geoms
   * This is not where you pick out the color or size... do that in geom_something
   * Aesthetics go inside aes(), constants go outside
- Aesthetic Mappings
   * x,y - position
   * color - point/line color
   * fill - area fill color
   * size - point/line size
   * shape - point shape
   * alpha - transparency
- regrex ignores cases when searching
- [Xx] is a trick to search for all capitalization variations
- ""Total.*population" = looking for "total something population"

## Questions & Challenges
- Remembering to update table names.

## Connections to Policy
- Policy Implications:
   * Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
   * Outliers may represent important communities
   * Relationships aren’t always linear

## Reflection
- I have to reclone my repo way too often.
- Class is moving on by without or without me ahaha!
