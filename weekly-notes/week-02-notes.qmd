## Key Concepts Learned
- Algorithms: sets of instructions for solving problems or completing tasks
- Data analytics is inherently subjective
- Algorithmic decision-making in government:
   * Assists or replaces human decision-makers
   * Relies on models that process historical data
- Inputs: "features," predictors, independent variables, x
- Outputs: "labels," outcomes, dependent variables, y
   * Promises efficiency, consistency, objectivity, and cost savings
- Margin of error (MOE):
   * Large MOE relative to estimate = less reliable
   * Small MOE relative to estimate = more reliable
   * "M" in data tables stands for margin of error

## Coding Techniques
- Clarified distinctions between:
   * Data science: algorithms/methods, computer science focus
   * Data analytics: applying data science methods across disciplines
   * Machine learning: algorithms for classification and prediction that learn from data
   * Artificial intelligence (AI): algorithms that adjust and improve across iterations

## Questions & Challenges
- When will I figure out Github!?

## Connections to Policy
- Real-World Examples
   * Criminal justice/recidivism risk
   * Housing & finance/mortgage lending    
   * Healthcare/patient care prioritization
- Government Data Collection History
   * Civic registration systems, census data, administrative records, operations research
- Why Census Data Matters
   * Foundation for understanding community demographics; allocating government resources; tracking neighborhood change; designing fair algorithms

## Reflection
- I'm slowly getting things... I think?
