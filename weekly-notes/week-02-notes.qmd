## Key Concepts Learned
**What is an Algorithm?**
- Set of instructions for solving a problem or completing a task

**Data Analytics is Subjective**

**Algorithmic Decision Making in Government**
- Systems used to assist or replace human decision-makers
- Based on predictions from models that process historical data containing:
	- Inputs (“features,” “predictors,” “independent variable”, “x”)
	- Outputs (“labels,” “outcome,” “dependent variable”, “y”)
- Promises efficiency, consistency, objectivity, and cost savings

**Margin of Errors**
- Large MOE relative to estimate = less reliable
- Small MOE relative to estimate = more reliable
- M stands for margin of error in data tables

## Coding Techniques
**Clarifying Key Terms**
- Data science - computer science/engineering focus on algorithms and methods
- Data analytics - application of data science methods to other disciplines
- Machine learning - algorithms for classification and prediction that learn from data
- AI - algorithms that adjust and improve across iterations

- Wide > long

## Questions & Challenges
- When will I figure GitHub out!?

## Connections to Policy
**Real-World Examples**
- Criminal justice/recidivism risk, housing & finance/mortgage lending, healthcare/patient care prioritization

**Government Data Collection History**
- Civic registration systems, census data, administrative records, operations research

**Why Census Data Matters**
- Foundation for: understanding community demographics; allocating government resources; tracking neighborhood change; designing fair algorithms

## Reflection
- I'm figuring things out... slowly but surely.
