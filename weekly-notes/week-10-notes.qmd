## Key Concepts Learned
- Problem with Linear Regression
  * Predictions can be > 1 or < 0 - makes no sense for probability
  * Assumes constant effect across range - not realistic
  * Violates regression assumptions
- Logistic Regression
  * Instead of predicting Y directly, predict the probability that Y = 1
- When Do We Use Logistic Regression?
  * Criminal Justice - will someone reoffend? will someone appear for court?
  * Urban Planning - will a building be demolished? will a hosuehold participate in some program?
  * Economics - will the loan default?
- The Logit Transformation
  * Models with the log odds, not the probability directly
- ROC Curve Points
  * x-axis = false positives
  * y-axis = true postives/recall
  * Area Under the Curve (AUC) - want to be bigger for finest model that catches the most true positives
