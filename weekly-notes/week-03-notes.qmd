## Key Concepts Learned
- Anscombe's Quartet
  * Four datasets with identical summary statistics
  * Same means, variances, correlation, and regression line
- The ggplot2 Philosophy
   * Data > aesthetics > geometries > visual
   * g <- ggplot(data = your_data) + aes(x = income, y = %_bach) + geom_something (color = "blue")
- Exploratory data analysis - what does the data look like? what patterns exist?

## Coding Techniques
- aes (aesthethic) describes how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties of geoms
   * This is not where you pick out the color or size... do that in geom_something
   * Aesthetics go inside aes(), constants go outside
- Aesthetic Mappings
   * x,y - position
   * color - point/line color
   * fill - area fill color
   * size - point/line size
   * shape - point shape
   * alpha - transparency
- regrex ignores cases when searching
- [Xx] is a trick to search for all capitalization variations
- ""Total.*population" = looking for "total something population"

## Questions & Challenges
- Remembering to update table names.

## Connections to Policy
- Policy Implications:
   * Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
   * Outliers may represent important communities
   * Relationships arenâ€™t always linear

## Reflection
- I have to reclone my repo way too often.
- Class is moving on by without or without me ahaha!
