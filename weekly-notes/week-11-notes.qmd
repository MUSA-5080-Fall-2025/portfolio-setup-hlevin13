## Key Concepts Learned
- Panel Data
  * Data that follows the same units over multiple time periods
  * Cross-sectional data - each row = one observation; one snapshot in time
  * Panel data - each row = unit * time period; repeat observations
- Binning data lets you aggregate/find patterns at the second-level
- Temporal Lags
  * Past demand predicts future demand
- Temporal Validation Problem
  * You cannot train on the future to predict the past

## Coding Techniques
- Lag Variables
  * lag1Hour = lag(Trip_Count, 1), # Previous hour
6
  * lag2Hours = lag(Trip_Count, 2), # 2 hours ago

## Connections to Policy
- Determining spatial patterns suggests infrastructure gaps in neighborhoods
- Temporal patterns reveal operational windows that may need to be adjusted
- High accuracy in:
  * High-income neighborhoods
  * Tourist areas
  * Transit hubs
- Lower accuracy in:
  * Lower-income neighborhoods
  * Residential periphery
  * Less transit access
- Could use panel data in transportation, public safety, housing, health, education, environment, or anytime you have same units observed repeatedly over time
