## Key Concepts Learned
- Dirty Data
  * Missing, incorrect, or non-standardized data/formats
  * Could be fabricated/manipulated, systemically biased, a proxy problem, or just missing
- Crime Data is Always:
  * Socially constructed
  * Selectively enforced
  * Organizationally filtered
  * Politically shaped
  * Technically mediated
- Consent Decrees Don't Address
  * Historical data generated during unconstitutional periods
  * Ongoing use of that data in algorithms
  * Data sharing with other jurisdictions
  * Vendor accountability for bias mitigation
  * Public transparency about predictive systems
- Global Measures
  * Moran’s I (one value for entire study area)
  * Answers “is there spatial clustering overall?”
  * Ranges from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (perfect positive clustering)
  * Doesn’t tell us where clusters are
- Local Measures
  * Local Moran’s I (one value per location)
  * Answers “where are the clusters?”
  * Maps show where patterns exist
- Spatial Weight Matrix: Foundation
  * W = weight between locations i and j
  * If i and j are neighbors: w > 0
  * If not neighbors: w ‎ =  0
- Count Regression
  * Can predict negative values
  * Assumes constant variance, continuous outcome, and normal errors
- Poisson Distribution
  * Appropriate for count data (number of crimes per week, number of calls per hour)
- Overdispersion Occurs:
  * Unobserved heterogeneity
  * Contagion effects
  * Measurement error
  * Model misspecification
- Fishnet Grid
  * Easier spatial operations
  * Consistent unit of analysis
  * Standard approach in predictive policing
  * 250m x 250m for fine-grained; 500m x 500m for standard; 1000m x 1000m for coarse
