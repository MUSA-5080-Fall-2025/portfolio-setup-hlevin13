## Key Concepts Learned
- K-means Clustering
  * Unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups observations into k clusters based on similarity
  * Assigns each observation to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid)
  * Iteratively updates cluster assignments and centroids until convergence
- Optimal Matching (OM) Algorithm
  * Classic approach - borrowed from DNA sequence analysis

## Coding Techniques
- Parameters
  * indel = 1: cost for insertion/deletion operations
  * otto = 0.1: origin-transition tradeoff parameter
  * norm = TRUE: normalize distances by sequence length

## Connections to Policy
- Sequences
  * Tell us patterns of change across metro areas
  * Where different processes (decline, gentrification) occur spatially
  * Racial and ethnic dynamics tied to socioeconomic change
