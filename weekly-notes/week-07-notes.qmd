## Key Concepts Learned
- Model Errors
  * y^i = predicted value
  * yi = actual value
- Good vs. Bad Errors
  * Good = random errors (no pattern)
  * Bad = clustered errors (spatial pattern visible)
- Moran's I
  * Measures spatial autocorrelation
  * +1 = perfect positive correlation (clustering)
  * 0 = random spatial pattern
  * -1 = perfect negative correlation (dispersion)
- Deviations
  * Positive deviation = over-predicted (actual > predicted)
  * Negative deviation = under-predicted (actual < predicted)
- Ways to Define Spatial Relationships
  * Contiguity - polygons that share a border
  * Distance - all within x meters
  * k-Nearest - closest k points
- Interpreting Moran's I
  * I > - and p < 0.05: significant clustering
  * I = 0: random pattern (good)
  * I < 0: dispersion (rare with errors)
- If Moran's I is high:
  * Add more spatial features
  * Try spatial fixed effects
  * Consider spatial regression models
- Biased vs. Inconsistent
  * Biased estimator - expected value does not equal true parameter
  * Inconsistent estimator - doesn't converge to true value as n -> infinity

## Questions & Challenges
- Applying all of this to the mid-term assignment

## Connections to Policy
- Using these concepts to create a housing price prediction modeling

## Reflection
- Each week keeps getting harder!
