But, the most interesting part, is seeing my\nwork come to life! Feeling like Dr. Frankenstein hehe.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected\ncounties.\n\n**Requirements:** - Geography: tract level - Variables: white alone\n(B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino\n(B03002_012), total population (B03002_001) - Use the same state and\nyear as before - Output format: wide - **Challenge:** You'll need county\ncodes, not names.

Because the sample sizes\nwere small, any discrepancy between E and M counts immediately hijacks\nthe MOE.\n\nMany of the MOEs for Black and Hispanic populations were zero, which\nforced R to print them as nfs. The data can therefore be understood as\nbeing less reliable.\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from\nall four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:** 1. **Overall Pattern\nIdentification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your\nanalyses? 2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest\nrisk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. **Root Cause\nAnalysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and\nbias risk? 4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department\nimplement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n1.  Systematic patterns that emerged from analyses fall within the\n    topics of data reliability and demographics. For instance, at the\n    county level, median household income estimates varied greatly in\n    reliability, with some noted as “low confidence.” When analyses\n    zoomed in to the tract level, reliability issues emerged when\n    examining Black and Hispanic populations. Many were discounted from\n    results, with analyses marking their stats as “lnf.”\n2.  Communities that face the greatest algorithmic bias are\n    rural/smaller populations, and diverse groups.\n3.  Underlying factors driving quality and bias risk issues include\n    small population sizes, uncertain counts of non-white populations,\n    and census polling limitations in rural areas.\n4.  To correctly count New York State’s populations, the Census Bureau\n    should intentionally plan and curate engagement in historically\n    undercounted areas/populations. Another idea is to alter the\n    algorithm to include better reliability metrics, like weighed\n    counts.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n\nspecific_recommendations <- ny_reliability %>%\n  select(NAME, median_h_incomeE, moe_percentage, reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    algorithm_rec = case_when(\n      reliability == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      reliability == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\nkable(specific_recommendations,\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Median Household Income\", \"MOE\", \"Reliability Interpretation\", \"Algorithm Recommendation\"),\n      caption = \"Decision Framework for Algorithm Implementation Across New York State Counties\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")\n)\n\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to\nthe department.\n\n1.  **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:**\n    Albany, Allegany, Bronx, Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua,\n    Chemung, Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess,\n    Erie, Franklin, Fulton, Genesee, Herkimer, Jefferson, Kings, Lewis,\n    Livingston, Madison, Monroe, Montgomery, Nassau, New York, Niagara,\n    Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Orange, Orleans, Oswego, Otsego, Putnam,\n    Queens, Rensselaer, Richmond, Rockland, St. Lawrence, Saratoga,\n    Schenectady, Schoharie, Steuben, Suffolk, Sullivan, Tioga, Tompkins,\n    Ulster, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Westchester, Wyoming\n\nThese counties are suitable as their MOE is less than 5%, an indication\nthat the data is reliable.\n\n2.  **Counties requiring additional oversight:** Essex, Greene,\n    Schuyler, Seneca, Yates\n\nThese counties need additional oversight as their MOE is between 5 and\n10%. To boost confidence, the algorithm should incorporate factors that\nweigh income data. Otherwise, more diligent processes would be required\nwhen conducting census sampling.\n\n3.  **Counties needing alternative approaches:** Hamilton\n\nThis county has an MOE greater than 10%, which indicates that the data\nis unreliable. To counteract this, manual review should occur to\nvalidate estimates before being processed by the algorithm. Otherwise,\nthe only two options are to incorporate local data into findings, or\nexclude all data until reliable findings are available.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1.  How have MOEs changed over time? Have demographic estimates improved\n    as the federal government now better recognizes minorities in the\n    US?\n2.  Is it a trend across over states to have clusters of high or low MOE\n    tracts? And if so, what is the common thread between these tracts?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** - U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey\n2018-2022 5-Year Estimates - Retrieved via tidycensus R package on\n9/28/25\n\n**Reproducibility:** - All analysis conducted in R version\n2025.05.1+513 - Census API key required for replication - Complete code\nand documentation available at: \\[your portfolio URL\\]\n\n**Methodology Notes:** N/A - no extreme decisions were made that would\naffect future reproducibility.\n\n**Limitations:** Limitations include sample size issues, geographic\nscope, and user success with R.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n-   [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n-   [ ] All \"\\[Fill this in\\]\" prompts have been completed\n-   [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n-   [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n-   [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n-   [ ] Census API key is properly set\n-   [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.\nYour assignment should be accessible at\n`your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.html`\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Assignment Overview\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou are a data analyst for the **New York State Department of Human\nServices**.

Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for\nhints.\n\n```{r tract-demographics}\n# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names\nraceVariables <- c(White = \"B03002_003\",\n                   Black = \"B03002_004\",\n                   Hispanic = \"B03002_012\",\n                   Total = \"B03002_001\")\n\n# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data\n# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter\ncensusTracts <- c(\"001\",\"031\",\"041\")\n\nacsData <- get_acs(\n    geography = \"tract\",\n    state = \"NY\",\n    county = censusTracts,\n    variables = raceVariables,\n    survey = \"acs5\",\n    year = 2022,\n    output = \"wide\"\n)\n\n# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()\n# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations\ngroup_percents <- acsData %>%\n  mutate(\n    white_percentage = round((WhiteE / TotalE) * 100),\n    black_percentage = round((BlackE / TotalE) * 100),\n    hispanic_percentage = round((HispanicE / TotalE) * 100)\n  )\n\n# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar\ngroup_percents <- group_percents %>%\n  mutate(NAME= str_extract(NAME, \"Albany|Essex|Hamilton\")\n  )\n         \n```\n\n## 3.3 Demographic Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.\n\n```{r demographic-analysis}\n# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents\n# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract\nhispanic_pop <- group_percents %>%\n  arrange(desc(hispanic_percentage)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(NAME, HispanicE, TotalE, hispanic_percentage)\n\n# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()\n# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group\naverages <- group_percents %>%\n  group_by(NAME) %>%\n  summarize(\n    tracts = n(),\n    avg_white_percent = round(mean(white_percentage, na.rm = TRUE), 0),\n    avg_black_percent = round(mean(black_percentage, na.rm = TRUE), 0),\n    avg_hispanic_percent = round(mean(hispanic_percentage, na.rm = TRUE), 0)\n  )\n\n# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()\nkable(averages,\n  col.names = c(\"County\", \"Number of Tracts\", \"Avg White %\", \"Avg Black %\", \"Avg Hispanic %\"),\n  caption = \"Average Percent of White, Black, and Hispanic Populations in Selected Counties\",\n  format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")\n)\n\n```\n\n# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation\n\n## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables\n\n**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see\nif some communities have less reliable data.\n\n**Requirements:** - Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic\nvariable - Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE \\> 15% -\nCreate summary statistics\n\n```{r demographic-moe}\n# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables\n# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)\nrace_moe <- group_percents %>%\n  mutate(\n    white_moe = round((WhiteM/WhiteE)*100, 2),\n    black_moe = round((BlackM/BlackE)*100, 2),\n    hispanic_moe = round(HispanicM/HispanicE*100, 2),\n  )\n\n# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable\n# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement\nrace_moe <- race_moe %>%\n  mutate(\n    high_moe = ifelse(\n      white_moe > 15 | black_moe > 15 | hispanic_moe > 15,\n      TRUE,\n      FALSE\n    )\n  )\n      \n# Create a summary showing count of counties in each reliability category\n# Hint: use count() and mutate() to add percentages\nrace_moe_summary <- race_moe %>%\n  count(high_moe) %>%\n  mutate(percentage = round(100*n/sum(n),1))\n\n# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues\nrace_moe_summary\n```\n\n## 4.2 Pattern Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly\ndistributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.\n\n```{r pattern-analysis}\n# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues\n# Calculate average characteristics for each group:\n# - population size, demographic percentages\npattern_analysis <- race_moe %>%\n  group_by(high_moe) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_tracts = n(),\n    avg_white = round(mean(white_moe, na.rm = TRUE), 0),\n    avg_black = round(mean(black_moe, na.rm = TRUE), 0),\n    avg_hispanic = round(mean(hispanic_moe, na.rm = TRUE), 0),\n    avg_pop = round(mean(TotalE, na.rm = TRUE), 0)\n    )\n\n# Use group_by() and summarize() to create this comparison\n\n# Create a professional table showing the patterns\nkable(pattern_analysis,\n        col.names = c(\"High MOE\", \"Number of Tracts\", \"Avg White MOE\", \"Avg Black MOE\", \"Avg Hispanic MOE\", \" Avg Pop\"),\n        caption = \"Comparison of Selected Tracts by MOE Reliability\",\n        format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")\n        )\n```\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nAll tracts were marked as having a high MOE. Because the sample sizes\nwere small, any discrepancy between E and M counts immediately hijacks\nthe MOE.\n\nMany of the MOEs for Black and Hispanic populations were zero, which\nforced R to print them as nfs. The data can therefore be understood as\nbeing less reliable.\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from\nall four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:** 1. **Overall Pattern\nIdentification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your\nanalyses? 2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest\nrisk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. **Root Cause\nAnalysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and\nbias risk? 4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department\nimplement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n1.  Systematic patterns that emerged from analyses fall within the\n    topics of data reliability and demographics. For instance, at the\n    county level, median household income estimates varied greatly in\n    reliability, with some noted as “low confidence.” When analyses\n    zoomed in to the tract level, reliability issues emerged when\n    examining Black and Hispanic populations. Many were discounted from\n    results, with analyses marking their stats as “lnf.”\n2.  Communities that face the greatest algorithmic bias are\n    rural/smaller populations, and diverse groups.\n3.  Underlying factors driving quality and bias risk issues include\n    small population sizes, uncertain counts of non-white populations,\n    and census polling limitations in rural areas.\n4.  To correctly count New York State’s populations, the Census Bureau\n    should intentionally plan and curate engagement in historically\n    undercounted areas/populations. Another idea is to alter the\n    algorithm to include better reliability metrics, like weighed\n    counts.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n\nspecific_recommendations <- ny_reliability %>%\n  select(NAME, median_h_incomeE, moe_percentage, reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    algorithm_rec = case_when(\n      reliability == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      reliability == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\nkable(specific_recommendations,\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Median Household Income\", \"MOE\", \"Reliability Interpretation\", \"Algorithm Recommendation\"),\n      caption = \"Decision Framework for Algorithm Implementation Across New York State Counties\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")\n)\n\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to\nthe department.\n\n1.  **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:**\n    Albany, Allegany, Bronx, Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua,\n    Chemung, Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess,\n    Erie, Franklin, Fulton, Genesee, Herkimer, Jefferson, Kings, Lewis,\n    Livingston, Madison, Monroe, Montgomery, Nassau, New York, Niagara,\n    Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Orange, Orleans, Oswego, Otsego, Putnam,\n    Queens, Rensselaer, Richmond, Rockland, St. Lawrence, Saratoga,\n    Schenectady, Schoharie, Steuben, Suffolk, Sullivan, Tioga, Tompkins,\n    Ulster, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Westchester, Wyoming\n\nThese counties are suitable as their MOE is less than 5%, an indication\nthat the data is reliable.\n\n2.  **Counties requiring additional oversight:** Essex, Greene,\n    Schuyler, Seneca, Yates\n\nThese counties need additional oversight as their MOE is between 5 and\n10%. To boost confidence, the algorithm should incorporate factors that\nweigh income data. Otherwise, more diligent processes would be required\nwhen conducting census sampling.\n\n3.  **Counties needing alternative approaches:** Hamilton\n\nThis county has an MOE greater than 10%, which indicates that the data\nis unreliable. To counteract this, manual review should occur to\nvalidate estimates before being processed by the algorithm. Otherwise,\nthe only two options are to incorporate local data into findings, or\nexclude all data until reliable findings are available.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1.  How have MOEs changed over time? Have demographic estimates improved\n    as the federal government now better recognizes minorities in the\n    US?\n2.  Is it a trend across over states to have clusters of high or low MOE\n    tracts? And if so, what is the common thread between these tracts?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** - U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey\n2018-2022 5-Year Estimates - Retrieved via
