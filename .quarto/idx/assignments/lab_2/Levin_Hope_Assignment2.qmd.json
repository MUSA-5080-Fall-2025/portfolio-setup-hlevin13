Low median household income (choose an appropriate\nthreshold) 2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate\nthreshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\nincome_threshold <- quantile (\n  census_tracts$median_incomeE, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\n# $55,924\n\ncensus_tracts <- census_tracts %>%\n  mutate(pct_over_65 = (over_65E / total_populationE) *100)\n\nage_threshold <- quantile (\n  census_tracts$pct_over_65, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n    \nvulnerable_pop <- census_tracts %>%\n  filter(\n    median_incomeE < income_threshold,\n    pct_over_65 > age_threshold\n  )\n\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    vulnerable = median_incomeE < income_threshold & pct_over_65 > age_threshold\n  )\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhat income threshold did you choose and why?\n\n-   My income threshold is the bottom 25%, or \\$55,924. By going with a\n    quantile approach, I was able to determine the cutoff in context of\n    the entire state.\n\nWhat elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\n-   Again, I went with a quantile approach for contextual understanding.\n    However, I choose the top 25% as I was interested in seeing tracts\n    with large elderly populations.\n\nHow many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n-   168 tracts meet both criterias.\n\nWhat percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your\ndefinition?\n\n-   4.87% of tracts.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest\nhospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\nvulnerable_pop <- st_transform(vulnerable_pop, crs = 3365)\n\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, crs = 3365)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroid <- st_centroid(vulnerable_pop)\n\ndistance_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroid, hospitals)\n\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    hospital_dis = apply(distance_matrix, 1, min),\n    hospital_miles = as.numeric(hospital_dis) / 1609.34)\n\n# Questions to answer\nvulnerable_pop %>%\n  summarise(\n    avg_distance = mean(hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_distance = max(hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    over_15 = sum(hospital_miles > 15, na.rm = TRUE)\n)\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:** - Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for\nPennsylvania - Calculate distances in miles - Explain why you chose your\nprojection\n\n-   I chose Pennsylvania State Plane South, as it is the projection that\n    I am most comfortable mapping with.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhat is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable\ntracts?\n\n-   The average distance to the nearest tract for vulnerable tracts is\n    13.5 miles.\n\nWhat is the maximum distance?\n\n-   The maximum distance is 62.9 miles.\n\nHow many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest\nhospital?\n\n-   47 tracts are more than 15 miles away from the nearest hospital.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas\n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles\nfrom the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = hospital_miles > 15 & median_incomeE < income_threshold & pct_over_65 > age_threshold\n  )\n\n# Questions to answer\nvulnerable_pop %>%\n  summarise(\n    underserved_count = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_tracts = n (),\n    underserved_pct = (underserved_count/total_tracts)*100\n  )\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nHow many tracts are underserved?\n\n-   47 tracts are underserved.\n\nWhat percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n-   Roughly 28% of tracts are underserved.\n\nDoes this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\n-   Somewhat...having gone to college in upstate New York, I'm well\n    aware of healthcare access disparities in rural America. However, I\n    was anticipating the number to be much lower, around 20-25%.\n    Shocking that such a high barrier exists given the supposed\n    advancements in this country.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics\nabout vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, crs = 3365)\nvulnerable_pop <- st_transform(vulnerable_pop, crs = 3365)\n\ntracts_with_counties <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties %>% select(COUNTY_NAM))\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\ncounty_stats <- tracts_with_counties %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    vulnerable_num = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_num = sum(underserved, na.rm =TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (underserved_num/vulnerable_num)*100,\n    hosp_dist = mean(hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total = sum (total_populationE, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:** - Number of vulnerable tracts -\nNumber of underserved tracts\\\n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved - Average\ndistance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts - Total vulnerable\npopulation\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhich 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable\ntracts?\n\n-   I found that 21 counties share the same percentage of underserved\n    vulnerable tracts - Armstrong, Cameron, Clarion, Clinton, Elk,\n    Forest, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson,\n    Juniata, Lebanon, McKean, Monroe, Norththumberland, Perry, Potter,\n    Somerset, and Tioga.\n\nWhich counties have the most vulnerable people living far from\nhospitals?\n\n-   The top 5 counties of vulnerable people living from hospitals are 1.\n    Monroe (58 miles), Perry, Franklin, Juniata, 5. Forest (50 miles).\n\nAre there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n-   Many of these counties are clustered in the Northwest, Central, and\n    Southeast Pennsylvania.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table\n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for\nhealthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\npriority_counties <- county_stats %>%\n  arrange(desc(hosp_dist)) %>%\n    slice(1:10) %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, total_tracts, total, pct_underserved, hosp_dist)\n\nkable(priority_counties,\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Vulnerable Tracts\", \"Total Population\", \"Underserved Vulnerable Tracts (%)\", \"Distance to Nearest Hospital (mi)\"),\n      caption = \"Top 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")\n)\n```\n\n**Requirements:** - Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting -\nInclude descriptive column names - Format numbers appropriately (commas\nfor population, percentages, etc.) - Add an informative caption - Sort\nby priority (you decide the metric)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization\n\nUsing the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create\npublication-quality maps and charts.\n\n### Map 1: County-Level Choropleth\n\nCreate a choropleth map showing healthcare access challenges at the\ncounty level.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create county-level access map\ncounty_map <- pa_counties %>%\n  st_transform(crs = st_crs(vulnerable_pop)) %>%\n  left_join(county_stats, by = \"COUNTY_NAM\")\n\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, crs = 3365)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = county_map, \n          aes(fill = pct_underserved), \n          color = \"black\", size = .25) +\n  geom_sf(data = hospitals,\n          color = \"white\",\n          size = 1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Percent Underserved\",\n    option = \"magma\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Healthcare Disparity Across Pennsylvania\",\n    subtitle = \"Percent of vulnerable census tracts underserved by county\",\n    caption = \"Source: ACS 2022 5-Year Estimates\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:** - Fill counties by percentage of vulnerable tracts\nthat are underserved - Include hospital locations as points - Use an\nappropriate color scheme - Include clear title, subtitle, and caption -\nUse `theme_void()` or similar clean theme - Add a legend with formatted\nlabels\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Map 2: Detailed Vulnerability Map\n\nCreate a map highlighting underserved vulnerable tracts.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create detailed tract-level map\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved_flag = ifelse (underserved == TRUE, \"Underserved\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nunique(vulnerable_pop$underserved_flag)\n\nggplot () +\n  geom_sf(data = vulnerable_pop,\n          aes(fill = underserved_flag),\n          color = \"grey\")+\n  geom_sf(data = pa_counties,\n          fill = NA,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 0.5) +\n  geom_sf(data = hospitals,\n          size = 2,\n          shape = 21,\n          fill = \"cornflowerblue\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Underserved\" = \"orchid\", \n                                  \"Other\" = \"darkorange\"),\n                    name = \"Vulnerability Status\")+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Underserved Vulnerable Tracts in Pennsylvania\",\n    subtitle = \"Census Tracts with Limited Access to Hospitals\",\n    caption = \"Source: ACS 2022 5-Year Estimates\"\n  )+\n  theme_void()\n\n                      \n```\n\n**Requirements:** - Show underserved vulnerable tracts in a contrasting\ncolor - Include county boundaries for context - Show hospital\nlocations - Use appropriate visual hierarchy (what should stand out?) -\nInclude informative title and subtitle\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Chart: Distribution Analysis\n\nCreate a visualization showing the distribution of distances to\nhospitals for vulnerable populations.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create distribution visualization\nggplot(vulnerable_pop, aes(x = hospital_miles)) +\n         geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n         labs(\n           title = \"Distribution of Distances to Nearest Hospital in Pennsylvania\",\n           subtitle = \"A clear disparity exists with some census tracts being 50+ miles from the nearest hospital\",\n           x = \"Distance to Nearest Hospital (mi)\",\n           y = \"Number of Tracts\",\n           caption = \"Source: ACS 2022 5-Year Estimates\"\n         )+\n         theme_minimal()\n\n```\n\n**Suggested chart types:** -

follow or make\nyour own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis\nshould include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS\nof your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long\nor geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include\nsome combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a\nrelatively straightforward question**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Education & Youth Services\n\n**Option A: Educational Desert Analysis** - **Data:** Schools,\nLibraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population) -\n**Question:** \"Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational\ninfrastructure for children?\" - **Operations:** Buffer schools/libraries\n(0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child\npopulation density -

**Operations:** Buffer schools (1000ft\nsafety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike\ninfrastructure coverage - **Policy relevance:** Safe Routes to School\nprograms, crossing guard placement\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Environmental Justice\n\n**Option C: Green Space Equity** - **Data:** Parks, Street Trees, Census\ntracts (race/income demographics) - **Question:** \"Do low-income and\nminority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?\" -\n**Operations:** Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree\ncanopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics - **Policy\nrelevance:** Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry\ninvestment ---\n\n#### Public Safety & Justice\n\n**Option D: Crime & Community Resources** - **Data:** Crime Incidents,\nRecreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights - **Question:** \"Are\nhigh-crime areas underserved by community resources?\" - **Operations:**\nAggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count\ncommunity resources per area, spatial correlation analysis - **Policy\nrelevance:** Community investment, violence prevention strategies ---\n\n#### Infrastructure & Services\n\n**Option E: Polling Place Accessibility** - **Data:** Polling Places,\nSEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates) -\n**Question:** \"Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled\nvoters?\" - **Operations:** Buffer polling places and transit stops,\nidentify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access - **Policy\nrelevance:** Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Health & Wellness\n\n**Option F: Recreation & Population Health** -

**Policy\nrelevance:** Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood\nidentity\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Data Sources\n\n**OpenDataPhilly:** https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets\navailable as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check\nthe Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\n\n**Additional Sources:** - **Pennsylvania Open Data:**\nhttps://data.pa.gov/ - **Census Bureau (via tidycensus):** Demographics,\neconomic indicators, commute patterns - **TIGER/Line (via tigris):**\nGeographic boundaries\n\n### Recommended Starting Points\n\n**If you're feeling confident:** Choose an advanced challenge with\nmultiple data layers. **If you are a beginner, choose something more\nmanageable that helps you understand the basics**\n\n**If you have a different idea:** Propose your own question! Just make\nsure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2\nspatial operations\n\n### Your Analysis\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1.  **Find and load additional data**\n    -   Document your data source\n    -   Check and standardize the CRS\n    -   Provide basic summary statistics\n\n```{r}\n# Load your additional dataset\nschools <- st_read(\"step_7_data/Schools.geojson\")\n  # OpenDataPhilly: unknown\n\ncrime <- st_read(\"step_7_data/crime_2022/incidents_part1_part2.shp\")\n  # OpenDataPhilly; 2022\n\nschools <- st_transform(schools, crs = 3365)\ncrime <- st_transform(crime, crs = 3365)\n\nsummary(schools)\nsummary(crime)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhat dataset did you choose and why?\n\n-   I chose to focus on the school safety zones, because I live near a\n    school and was curious about the chance of them being crime\n    hotspots!\n\nWhat is the data source and date?\n\n-   Everything was sourced from OpenDataPhilly. I was unable to find the\n    sourcing date for the school data, however, the crime data comes\n    from 2022 (wanted to match it with the ACS data I pulled earlier).\n\nHow many features does it contain?\n\n-   There are 2 features.\n\nWhat CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\n-   I transformed everything to be in NAD83 Pennsylvania South.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.  **Pose a research question**\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\n\n**Examples:** - \"Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit\naccess to hospitals?\" - \"Are EMS stations appropriately located near\nvulnerable populations?\" - \"Do areas with low vehicle access have worse\nhospital access?\"\n\n\"How much crime occurs near Philadelphia schools?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.  **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):** - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial\nfiltering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or\nunions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Your spatial analysis\n\n# Set CRS\nschools <- st_transform(schools, crs = 3365)\ncrime <- st_transform(crime, crs = 3365)\n\n# Create 1000ft buffers around each school to represent the safety zones\nschool_buffer <- schools %>%\n  st_buffer (dist = 1000) %>%\n  st_union() %>%\n  st_as_sf()\n\n# Determine crimes within buffers/safety zones\ncrime_near_school <- st_join(\n  crime, school_buffer,\n  join = st_within, left = FALSE\n)\n\n# Count total crimes and the number that happened near schools\ncrime_total <- nrow(crime)\ncrime_schoolzone <- nrow(crime_near_school)\n\n# Find percent of crimes near schools\ncrime_percent <- round((crime_schoolzone / crime_total) *100, 2)\n\n# Results\ncat(\"Total Crimes:\", crime_total, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Crimes within 1000ft of schools:\", crime_schoolzone, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Percent of crimes within 1000ft of schools:\", crime_percent, \"%\\n\")\n\n# Map\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = crime,\n          color = \"tomato\",\n          size = .5,\n          alpha = .1) +\n   geom_sf(data = school_buffer,\n          fill = \"navyblue\",\n          alpha = .8) +\n  geom_sf(data = schools,\n          color = \"deepskyblue3\",\n          size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"School Safety Zones and Crime in Philadelphia, PA\",\n    subtitle = \"1000ft Safety Buffer Around Schools and Locations of Crime\",\n    caption = \"Source: OpenDataPhilly\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n```\n\n**Analysis requirements:** - Clear code comments explaining each step -\nAppropriate CRS transformations - Summary statistics or counts - At\nleast one map showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results\n(3-5 sentences)\n\n**Your interpretation:**\n\nTotal Crimes: 151,197 Crimes Within 1000ft of schools: 74,198 Percent of\nCrimes Within 1000ft of Schools: 49.07%\n\nConsidering 49% of crimes occur within 1000ft of schools, there is a\nclear need for additional measures to ensure that Philadelphia's youth\nare kept safe. If speeding is an issue, then perhaps crossing guards can\nbe kept on for additional hours or in farther places. If its a bigger\nissue - like murder or drug trafficking - then police presence!

Low median household income (choose an appropriate\nthreshold) 2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate\nthreshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\nincome_threshold <- quantile (\n  census_tracts$median_incomeE, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\n# $55,924\n\ncensus_tracts <- census_tracts %>%\n  mutate(pct_over_65 = (over_65E / total_populationE) *100)\n\nage_threshold <- quantile (\n  census_tracts$pct_over_65, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n    \nvulnerable_pop <- census_tracts %>%\n  filter(\n    median_incomeE < income_threshold,\n    pct_over_65 > age_threshold\n  )\n\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    vulnerable = median_incomeE < income_threshold & pct_over_65 > age_threshold\n  )\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhat income threshold did you choose and why?\n\n-   My income threshold is the bottom 25%, or \\$55,924. By going with a\n    quantile approach, I was able to determine the cutoff in context of\n    the entire state.\n\nWhat elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\n-   Again, I went with a quantile approach for contextual understanding.\n    However, I choose the top 25% as I was interested in seeing tracts\n    with large elderly populations.\n\nHow many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n-   168 tracts meet both criterias.\n\nWhat percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your\ndefinition?\n\n-   4.87% of tracts.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest\nhospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\nvulnerable_pop <- st_transform(vulnerable_pop, crs = 3365)\n\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, crs = 3365)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroid <- st_centroid(vulnerable_pop)\n\ndistance_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroid, hospitals)\n\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    hospital_dis = apply(distance_matrix, 1, min),\n    hospital_miles = as.numeric(hospital_dis) / 1609.34)\n\n# Questions to answer\nvulnerable_pop %>%\n  summarise(\n    avg_distance = mean(hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_distance = max(hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    over_15 = sum(hospital_miles > 15, na.rm = TRUE)\n)\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:** - Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for\nPennsylvania - Calculate distances in miles - Explain why you chose your\nprojection\n\n-   I chose Pennsylvania State Plane South, as it is the projection that\n    I am most comfortable mapping with.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhat is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable\ntracts?\n\n-   The average distance to the nearest tract for vulnerable tracts is\n    13.5 miles.\n\nWhat is the maximum distance?\n\n-   The maximum distance is 62.9 miles.\n\nHow many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest\nhospital?\n\n-   47 tracts are more than 15 miles away from the nearest hospital.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas\n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles\nfrom the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\nvulnerable_pop <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = hospital_miles > 15 & median_incomeE < income_threshold & pct_over_65 > age_threshold\n  )\n\n# Questions to answer\nvulnerable_pop %>%\n  summarise(\n    underserved_count = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_tracts = n (),\n    underserved_pct = (underserved_count/total_tracts)*100\n  )\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nHow many tracts are underserved?\n\n-   47 tracts are underserved.\n\nWhat percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n-   Roughly 28% of tracts are underserved.\n\nDoes this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\n-   Somewhat...having gone to college in upstate New York, I'm well\n    aware of healthcare access disparities in rural America. However, I\n    was anticipating the number to be much lower, around 20-25%.\n    Shocking that such a high barrier exists given the supposed\n    advancements in this country.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics\nabout vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, crs = 3365)\nvulnerable_pop <- st_transform(vulnerable_pop, crs = 3365)\n\ntracts_with_counties <- vulnerable_pop %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties %>% select(COUNTY_NAM))\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\ncounty_stats <- tracts_with_counties %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    vulnerable_num = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_num = sum(underserved, na.rm =TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (underserved_num/vulnerable_num)*100,\n    hosp_dist = mean(hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total = sum (total_populationE, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:** - Number of vulnerable tracts -\nNumber of underserved tracts\\\n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved - Average\ndistance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts - Total vulnerable\npopulation\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhich 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable\ntracts?\n\n-   I found that 21 counties share the same percentage of underserved\n    vulnerable tracts - Armstrong, Cameron, Clarion, Clinton, Elk,\n    Forest, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson,\n    Juniata, Lebanon, McKean, Monroe, Norththumberland, Perry, Potter,\n    Somerset, and Tioga.\n\nWhich counties have the most vulnerable people living far from\nhospitals?\n\n-   The top 5 counties of vulnerable people living from hospitals are 1.\n    Monroe (58 miles), Perry, Franklin, Juniata, 5. Forest (50 miles).\n\nAre there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n-   Many of these counties are clustered in the Northwest, Central, and\n    Southeast Pennsylvania.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table\n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for\nhealthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\npriority_counties <- county_stats %>%\n  arrange(desc(hosp_dist)) %>%\n    slice(1:10) %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, total_tracts, total, pct_underserved, hosp_dist)\n\nkable(priority_counties,\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Vulnerable Tracts\", \"Total Population\", \"Underserved Vulnerable Tracts (%)\", \"Distance to Nearest Hospital (mi)\"),\n      caption = \"Top 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")\n)\n```\n\n**Requirements:** -

Most datasets\navailable as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check\nthe Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\n\n**Additional Sources:** - **Pennsylvania Open Data:**\nhttps://data.pa.gov/ - **Census Bureau (via tidycensus):** Demographics,\neconomic indicators, commute patterns - **TIGER/Line (via tigris):**\nGeographic boundaries\n\n### Recommended Starting Points\n\n**If you're feeling confident:** Choose an advanced challenge with\nmultiple data layers. **If you are a beginner, choose something more\nmanageable that helps you understand the basics**\n\n**If you have a different idea:** Propose your own question! Just make\nsure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2\nspatial operations\n\n### Your Analysis\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1.  **Find and load additional data**\n    -   Document your data source\n    -   Check and standardize the CRS\n    -   Provide basic summary statistics\n\n```{r}\n# Load your additional dataset\nschools <- st_read(\"step_7_data/Schools.geojson\")\n  # OpenDataPhilly: unknown\n\ncrime <- st_read(\"step_7_data/crime_2022/incidents_part1_part2.shp\")\n  # OpenDataPhilly; 2022\n\nschools <- st_transform(schools, crs = 3365)\ncrime <- st_transform(crime, crs = 3365)\n\nsummary(schools)\nsummary(crime)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\nWhat dataset did you choose and why?\n\n-   I chose to focus on the school safety zones, because I live near a\n    school and was curious about the chance of them being crime\n    hotspots!\n\nWhat is the data source and date?\n\n-   Everything was sourced from OpenDataPhilly. I was unable to find the\n    sourcing date for the school data, however, the crime data comes\n    from 2022 (wanted to match it with the ACS data I pulled earlier).\n\nHow many features does it contain?\n\n-   There are 2 features.\n\nWhat CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\n-   I transformed everything to be in NAD83 Pennsylvania South.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.  **Pose a research question**\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\n\n**Examples:** - \"Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit\naccess to hospitals?\" - \"Are EMS stations appropriately located near\nvulnerable populations?\" - \"Do areas with low vehicle access have worse\nhospital access?\"\n\n\"How much crime occurs near Philadelphia schools?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.  **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):** - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial\nfiltering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or\nunions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Your spatial analysis\n\n# Set CRS\nschools <- st_transform(schools, crs = 3365)\ncrime <- st_transform(crime, crs = 3365)\n\n# Create 1000ft buffers around each school to represent the safety zones\nschool_buffer <- schools %>%\n  st_buffer (dist = 1000) %>%\n  st_union() %>%\n  st_as_sf()\n\n# Determine crimes within buffers/safety zones\ncrime_near_school <- st_join(\n  crime, school_buffer,\n  join = st_within, left = FALSE\n)\n\n# Count total crimes and the number that happened near schools\ncrime_total <- nrow(crime)\ncrime_schoolzone <- nrow(crime_near_school)\n\n# Find percent of crimes near schools\ncrime_percent <- round((crime_schoolzone / crime_total) *100, 2)\n\n# Results\ncat(\"Total Crimes:\", crime_total, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Crimes within 1000ft of schools:\", crime_schoolzone, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"Percent of crimes within 1000ft of schools:\", crime_percent, \"%\\n\")\n\n# Map\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = crime,\n          color = \"tomato\",\n          size = .5,\n          alpha = .1) +\n   geom_sf(data = school_buffer,\n          fill = \"navyblue\",\n          alpha = .8) +\n  geom_sf(data = schools,\n          color = \"deepskyblue3\",\n          size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"School Safety Zones and Crime in Philadelphia, PA\",\n    subtitle = \"1000ft Safety Buffer Around Schools and Locations of Crime\",\n    caption = \"Source: OpenDataPhilly\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n```\n\n**Analysis requirements:** - Clear code comments explaining each step -\nAppropriate CRS transformations - Summary statistics or counts - At\nleast one map showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results\n(3-5 sentences)\n\n**Your interpretation:**\n\nTotal Crimes: 151,197 Crimes Within 1000ft of schools: 74,198 Percent of\nCrimes Within 1000ft of Schools: 49.07%\n\nConsidering 49% of crimes occur within 1000ft of schools, there is a\nclear need for additional measures to ensure that Philadelphia's youth\nare kept safe. If speeding is an issue, then perhaps crossing guards can\nbe kept on for additional hours or in farther places. If its a bigger\nissue - like murder or drug trafficking - then police presence! However,\nbecause the dataset does not report the type of crime committed, further\ninvestigation is needed to determine what is needed.\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\n\nTake a few moments to clean up your markdown document and then write a\nline or two or three about how you may have incorporated feedback that\nyou recieved after your first assignment.\n\nHopefully I hid my API key this time!
