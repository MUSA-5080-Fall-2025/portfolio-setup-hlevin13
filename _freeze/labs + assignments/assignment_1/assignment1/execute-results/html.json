The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

Consider: Which counties might be poorly served by algorithms that rely on this income data? What factors might contribute to higher uncertainty?]\n\nCounties that have a high MOE/those marked as the \"Low Confidence\" may be poorly served by algorithms, as it is assumed that the data inputted is precise. These counties tend to be in rural areas, where the population size is much smaller than their urban or suburban counterparts, therefore creating a smaller sample size.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- ny_reliability %>%\n  filter(NAME %in% c(\"Albany \", \"Essex \", \"Hamilton \"))\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselected_counties %>%\n  select(\n    County = NAME,\n    Median_Income = median_h_incomeE,\n    MOE_Percentage = moe_percentage,\n    Reliability = reliability\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  County      Median_Income MOE_Percentage Reliability        \n  <chr>               <dbl>          <dbl> <chr>              \n1 \"Albany \"           78829           2.6  High Confidence    \n2 \"Essex \"            68090           5.27 Moderate Confidence\n3 \"Hamilton \"         66891          11.4  Low Confidence     \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** \nInteresting how Hamilton and Essex County are border each other, and are predominantly known for the Adirondacks, yet have such different population and MOE figures.

Do certain types of communities have less reliable data? What might explain this?]\nAll tracts were marked as having a high MOE. Because the sample sizes were small, any discrepancy between E and M counts immediately hijacks the MOE.\n\nMany of the MOEs for Black and Hispanic populations were zero, which forced R to print them as nfs. The data can therefore be understood as being less reliable.\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n1. Systematic patterns that emerged from analyses fall within the topics of data reliability and demographics. For instance, at the county level, median household income estimates varied greatly in reliability, with some noted as “low confidence.” When analyses zoomed in to the tract level, reliability issues emerged when examining Black and Hispanic populations. Many were discounted from results, with analyses marking their stats as “lnf.”\n2. Communities that face the greatest algorithmic bias are rural/smaller populations, and diverse groups. \n3. Underlying factors driving quality and bias risk issues include small population sizes, uncertain counts of non-white populations, and census polling limitations in rural areas.\n4. To correctly count New York State’s populations, the Census Bureau should intentionally plan and curate engagement in historically undercounted areas/populations. Another idea is to alter the algorithm to include better reliability metrics, like weighed counts.\n\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

To boost confidence, the algorithm should incorporate factors that weigh income data. Otherwise, more diligent processes would be required when conducting census sampling.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]\n\nHamilton\n\nThis county has an MOE greater than 10%, which indicates that the data is unreliable. To counteract this, manual review should occur to validate estimates before being processed by the algorithm. Otherwise, the only two options are to incorporate local data into findings, or exclude all data until reliable findings are available.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]\n\n1. How have MOEs changed over time? Have demographic estimates improved as the federal government now better recognizes minorities in the US?\n2. Is it a trend across over states to have clusters of high or low MOE tracts? And if so, what is the common thread between these tracts?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 9/28/25\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 2025.05.1+513\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [your portfolio URL]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nN/A - no extreme decisions were made that would affect future reproducibility. \n\n**Limitations:**\nLimitations include sample size issues, geographic scope, and user success with R.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
